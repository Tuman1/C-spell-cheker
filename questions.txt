0.  pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis is the largest word in dictionary.
1.  getrusage() returns resource usage measures.
2.  16 members
3.  Maby it was done to track currant values in "befor" and "after" structures.
4.      For loop is initialized with statement that creates a variable c and put char from text into it. Due to "c != EOF"  and "c = fgetc(fp)" statements
    all characters will be read from input text. During execution of For loop a few counters will be changed: index - length of current word,
    words - number of words, misspellings - words that have error. Current word is located in array word[length + 1].
        There are a few check statments. First statement check is character letter or apostrophes and adding character to the array "word".
    If word larger than 45 letters, other letters are omitted, during to "while ((c = fgetc(fp)) != EOF && isalpha(c));". At the end of the statement that check size of the word
    index counter is reset for the new word.
        Next "esle if" statment check for the digits and omitt them.
        Last "esle if" statment is checking for the end of the word and make check of the word.
5.  We can't use scanf() because we need to check every character to ensure that there is no any forbidden character.
6.  Because we have been assumed that inputs dictionary and word must be accessible from all modules. Thats why the are static variables.
7.  I have used "trie" data structure. There are  two variable in each node: in_word and array of pointers to children nodes.
8.  It was about 0.14 second.
9.  I didn't.
10. I would like to replace memset() with macro if it's possible.
